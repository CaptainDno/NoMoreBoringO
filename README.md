# No more boring 'O'

Tired of letter 'O' being so simple and boring?
This *very* useful Chrome extension that *certainly* was *not* a total waste of time to create
replaces all standard letters 'o' with different variants.

### Replacement variants
```javascript
const REPLACEMENTS_UPPER = ['Ꙩ', 'ꙮ', 'Ꙫ', 'Ꙭ', 'Ꚙ', 'Ꚛ', 'Ѻ', 'Ó', 'Õ', 'Ö', 'Ò', 'Ô']
const REPLACEMENTS_LOWER = ['ꙩ', 'ꙫ', 'ꙭ', 'ꚙ', 'ꚛ', 'ѻ', 'ó', 'õ', 'ö', 'ò', 'ô']
```
